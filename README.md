calendar app from pdf.

i swear every time i think i know what will work, i either give up trying or end up finding a slighter better way to make it happen.

 I found the new google LangExtract on LinkedIn so I think that'd be a cool opportunity to use SoTA technology within this project.

After a day of kind of just messing around, I think the strack to make these syallabi entirely useful for LLMs we'd need to convert PDF to PNG, PNG to text with TesseractPy, then summarize and test with the New LangExtract feature.

I'm aiming to create accurate and insightful calendars easier than ever.
